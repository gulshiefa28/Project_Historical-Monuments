    <li>Name: The Great China Wall </li>
    <li>Country: China</li>
    <li>Intro: One of the world’s largest man-made structures.</li>
    <li>History summary: Built over several dynasties from the 7th century BCE to protect China from invasions.</li>
    <li>Highlights: 21,000+ km long, UNESCO Heritage Site</li>
    <li>📌 Description

The Great Wall of China is one of the world’s most iconic man-made structures. It stretches across mountains, deserts, valleys, and grasslands in northern China, covering thousands of kilometers. The wall was built using stone, bricks, tamped earth, and wood. From the top, it offers stunning views of the surrounding landscapes.</li>
    <li>📜 History

The Great Wall was not built all at once. It was constructed over 2,300+ years, by different Chinese dynasties to protect the empire from invasions.</li>
    <li>🔹 Origin (7th–4th century BCE)

The earliest walls were built by small Chinese kingdoms during the Warring States Period to defend their territories.</li>
    <li>🔹 Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE) – First Unified Wall

When Emperor Qin Shi Huang united China, he connected many regional walls into one long defensive system.
This is considered the first version of the “Great Wall.”</li>
    <li>🔹 Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE)

The wall was extended westward to protect trade routes such as the Silk Road.</li>
    <li>🔹 Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 CE) – The Modern Wall

Most of the wall seen today was rebuilt by the Ming Dynasty using
strong bricks, stones, and watchtowers.
This period created the 40,000+ towers, fortresses, and long stone walls that tourists visit today.</li>
